# ARKit-Dojo
A sample project that explores how AR Kit works by adding 3D models to your environment.

# Purpose
This is a small project that helps me understand how AR Kit works by rendering 3D objects into my physical space via my phone camera. It's quite a lot to learn but a really interesting one to see how ARKit is able to detect plane surfaces and reconstruct the view that I see from my device.

If you want to create your own 3D object, read along this resource. Once you have generated one, feel free to add it under ARKit_Dojo_Short/Models along with other usdz files.
